I am a PhD candidate in the department of Economics, Cornell University, working under the supervision of [Kristoffer Nimark](http://www.kris-nimark.net/), [Maxim Troshkin](http://www.troshkin.com/) and [Christopher Huckfeldt](https://christopher-huckfeldt.github.io/).

My research interests are in macroeconomics and public finance. I am currently working on the role of financial constraints in firm investment responses to monetary policy shocks. I am also interested in using natural language processing technique in macroeconomics research.
