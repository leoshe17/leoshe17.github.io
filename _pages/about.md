I am a Ph.D. candidate in the department of Economics, Cornell University, working under the supervision of [Kristoffer Nimark](http://www.kris-nimark.net/), [Christopher Huckfeldt](https://christopher-huckfeldt.github.io/) and [Yifei Mao](https://sha.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/ym355/).

My research interests are in macroeconomics and public finance. I am currently working on the role of financial constraints in firm investment responses to monetary policy shocks. I am also interested in using natural language processing technique in macroeconomics research.

__I will be available for interviews at the 2020 ASSA Annual Meeting in San Diego.__
