I am a PhD candidate in the department of Economics, Cornell University, working under the supervision of Kristoffer Nimark, Maxim Troshkin and Christopher Huckfeldt.

My research interests are in macroeconomics and public finance. I am currently working on the role of financial constraint in firm investment response to monetary policy shock. I am also interested in using natural language programming technique in macroeconomics research.
