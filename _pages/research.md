Financial Constraints, Monetary Policy and Firm Investments: A Deep Learning Approach (_JMP_, [Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4fls9td8394w5o9/paper_draft.pdf?dl=0))
> My paper studies the role of financial constraints in the effects of monetary policy on firm investments. I construct a quarterly measure of financial constraints with SEC filings using a deep learning model which improves the prediction accuracy as compared to Naive Bayes method by capturing the context information such as grammatical structure and order of words. The highly constrained firms are younger, smaller, have higher liquidity ratio and higher leverage ratio. However, popular proxies of financial constraints often don't move monotonically with the level of financial constraints, especially for the liquidity ratio which is high for both the most constrained firms and the least constrained firms. Using the constructed measure of financial constraints, the investments of financially constrained firms are persistently less responsive to monetary policy shocks due to high marginal cost of external funds. My results shed light on previous empirical findings and argue that the seemingly contrary conclusions are, to some extent, consistent with each other.
