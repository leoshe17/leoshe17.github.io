Working Paper
===
Financial Constraint, Firm Investment and Monetary Policy: A Natural Language Programming Approach(_JMP_, draft coming soon)
> The paper studies the role of financial constraints in the investment responses to monetary policy shock. We constructs a novel firm level financial constraint index from quarterly and annual report files using natural language programming model. The highly constrained firms measured from the index pay lower dividends, hold more cash, have higher leverage ratio and higher Tobinâ€™q. Their investments are also more sensitive to cash flow changes. Finally, the investment responses to monetary policy shock are less for the firms that are more constrained.
