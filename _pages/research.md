Financial Constraints, Monetary Policy and Firm Investments: A Deep Learning Approach (_JMP_, [Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p9pjsab02a4ie8y/JMP_YS.pdf?dl=0))
> My paper studies the role of financial constraints in the effects of monetary policy on firm investments. I construct a quarterly measure of financial constraints with SEC filings using a deep learning model which improves the prediction accuracy as compared to Naive Bayes method by capturing the context information such as grammatical structure and order of words. The highly constrained firms are younger, smaller, have higher liquidity ratio and higher leverage ratio. However, popular proxies of financial constraints often don't move monotonically with the level of financial constraints, especially for the liquidity ratio which is high for both the most constrained firms and the least constrained firms. Using the constructed measure of financial constraints, the investments of financially constrained firms are persistently less responsive to monetary policy shocks due to high marginal cost of external funds. My results shed light on previous empirical findings and argue that the seemingly contrary conclusions are, to some extent, consistent with each other.

Work in Progress
=====
Implications of Optimal Taxes for the Evolution of Wealth Inequality (Work in Progress with Maxim Troshkin)
> Quantifies counterfactual consequences of optimal dynamic taxation for inequality, within a computational model matching evolution of wealth and income distributions in the U.S. over five decades

A Welfare Approach on Proxy Means Testing (Work in Progress with David Coady, IMF)
> We propose a new proxy means tests with minimizing welfare loss as target instead of traditional targets, such as minimizing consumption loss. The new method reduces the inclusion error and the exclusion error. We compare the performances between our method and the traditional method using India household survey data.
